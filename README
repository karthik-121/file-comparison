There were many parts to this project and we worked through it in steps. We first decided to make directory
and file queues work with one thread and once we did that, only then we implemented the threads. We made sure
all combinations of files and directories worked when obtaining the final repository list. We test empty directories, 
directories with many subdirectories within, and if the arguments given were only files. After all this worked we
proceeded to the analysis phase where again we tested a bunch of different types of files. Files that were empty
had to have a JSD of 0, whereas if one file was empty and another was not, their JSD was approximately 0.7070. When
we were sure that all these types of file combinations worked when calcating the JSD, as well as other files that both 
had content worked, we were sure that our code was correct.
